Hey, this is the landing page for my personal Github.
Thanks for coming.
There's not much here for the public, just some little bits and bobs,
mostly for maintenance purposes over multiple devices and little tweaks that make my life easier.

	A list of things to do. I'll be filling up more of this soon as I continue to organize my work,

.\Registry_ContextMenus
	Where I store some registry tweaks. Only the registry keys related to my Windows KDE Konsole
	(so kindly provided through MSYS2's ported Unix environment) is in here so far. Adds
	shell/open-here integration for MSYS2 (UCRT64) Bash and Powershell 7.4 (Preview)
	Plan to add a few "Create New > (File)" Context Menu shell extensions in here later.

ascii-art.ans
	Payonpa! This little guy is an Ansi/Ascii art thing, for me to put in my bash/powershell profiles
	on startup and put a smile on my face. Maybe you might recognize them?
